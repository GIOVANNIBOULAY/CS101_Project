exordium = """
    1. the purpose of this section is to outline the boundaries between the fundamental parts of this machine.
    2. it is important to understand what each part does.
    3. it is also important to understand the boundaries between parts; in other words, where one part ends and another begins.
    4. being clear about these distinctions can help with accurately subdividing the machine into even smaller pieces.
    5. there are three essential parts (or levels):
        - DIRECTION
        - EXECUTION
        - TECHNIQUE
    6. each level contains its own section with details about every operation it performs.
"""
direction = """
    1. DIRECTION operates as the 'why' of the operation.
    2. the DIRECTOR operates the gut (or heart) of the machine.
    3. existential questions are asked and ideas about how they could be answered are generated, but everything remains theoretical.
    4. this is where brainstorming happens (an activity where the heart is allowed to express itself without intervention).
    5. in other words, the DIRECTOR determines where he wants the machine to go and why.
"""
execution = """
    1. EXECUTION operates as the 'how' of the operation.
    2. once the gut expresses itself, once the heart is decided, it is the brain’s to make sense of it through logic.
    3. at this level, EXECUTIVES design algorithms they believe will create the optimal result.
    4. if the DIRECTOR defines the problem, the EXECUTIVE hypotheses on solutions.
    5. EXECUTIVES think critically about how to best EXECUTE the DIRECTOR’s ideas.
    6. once a destination is determined, the EXECUTIVE decides the best way to get there.
"""
technique = """
    1. this is the 'what' of the operation.

    4. this is where the TECHNICIAN comes in.
    5. their job is to act on the EXECUTIVE’s decisions.
"""
bottom_up = """
    1. communication is crucial in keeping the entire operation functional.
    2. each level of the organization is introduced from the TOP-DOWN, but communication must also happen from the bottom up.
    3. the TECHNICIAN must be able to communicate with the EXECUTIVE who must in turn be able to communicate with the DIRECTOR.
    4. as the one responsible for following the algorithm, the TECHNICIAN may often be the first to find flaws in its design.
    5. once these flaws are found, they must be escalated to the EXECUTIVE, who then becomes responsible for fixing them.
    6. in the end, a new and improved algorithm is created.
    7. if problems persist for the TECHNICIAN, the EXECUTIVE must then rethink the entire algorithm, and maybe create a new one.
    8. the TECHNICIAN and EXECUTIVE should always be in communication.
